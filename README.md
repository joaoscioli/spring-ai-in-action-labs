# 🤖 Spring AI in Action Labs

> Exploring the power of AI within the Spring ecosystem — inspired by *Spring AI in Action* by Craig Walls (Foreword by Rod Johnson).

## 🚀 Overview
This repository is a collection of experiments and prototypes that blend **Spring Boot** and **Artificial Intelligence**.  
It’s part of my ongoing research to understand how **AI-driven services** can enhance modern backend systems written in Java.

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn and apply **Spring AI** concepts to build intelligent microservices.
- Integrate **LLMs (Large Language Models)** using Spring AI and **LangChain4j**.
- Experiment with **text generation**, **chatbots**, and **contextual retrieval**.
- Connect AI models to real-world applications via Spring Boot APIs.
- Explore **vector databases** and **prompt engineering** in Java.
